Use the following code to evaluate the boosting algorithm and get results for different random queries.

> python

## Dataset
We have used the california housing dataset but since there are limitations on data size and queries as defined in paper, we are choosing only first 2000 enteries of the dataset.
Although we have loaded the dataset from the scikit learn library but the link of the data is provided below
